The haiku is a Japanese verse in three lines.
Line one has 5 syllables, line 2 has 7 syllables
and line three has 5 syllables. Haiku is a mood poem
and it doesn't use any metaphors or similes. Usually
when Haiku is taught the students are only given the
restriction of the number of lines and syllables.
